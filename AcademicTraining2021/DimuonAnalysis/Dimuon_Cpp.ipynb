    "# ROOT dataframe tutorial: Dimuon spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROOT dataframe tutorial shows you how to analyze datasets using `RDataFrame`. The example analysis performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect a ROOT dataframe to a dataset containing 66 mio. events recorded by CMS in 2012\n",
    "2. Filter the events being relevant for your analysis\n",
    "3. Compute the invariant mass of the selected dimuon candidates\n",
    "4. Plot the invariant mass spectrum showing resonances up to the Z mass\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook runs out-of-the-box. However, you are encouraged to tweak the code to see the effect on the result! \n",
